# TIMS
Created in Java, TIMS (Transaction Information Management System), purpose of this system is to develop an online banking system that provides customers with the facility to check their accounts and do transactions online. The system will provide all the bank's facilities to its customers when their authentications (user ID and password) match, including viewing account information, performing transfers, giving the customer an option of changing address, paying bills online, password retrieval, performing transactions, viewing transactions and the locations of the bank's branches. 
The system should also support an online enrollment facility for credit card customers and/or mortgage customers; and should allow customers to view their personal accounts and to pay bills online from their account. 
The system should assign a unique transaction number to every transaction that a user makes. The customer should be able to access his/her account from anywhere just by inputting the correct user ID and password.
